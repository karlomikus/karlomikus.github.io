[E-Dnevnik](https://www.carnet.hr/en/e_class_register) is a web application for the management of the class register in electronic form, which began as a pilot project at the beginning of the 2011/2012 school year. In school year 2014/2015 30% of schools is using e-Class Registry. I've worked on feature implementations, rewriting, architecture design and maintenance in all areas of application.
