Validate, generate and extract data from JMBG (Unique Master Citizen Number).

Hugo provides its own webserver which builds and serves the site. While hugo server is high performance, it is a webserver with limited options. Many run it in production, but the standard behavior is for people to use it in development and use a more full featured server such as Nginx or Caddy.

â€˜hugo serverâ€™ will avoid writing the rendered and served content to disk, preferring to store it in memory.

By default hugo will also watch your files for any changes you make and automatically rebuild the site. It will then live reload any open browser pages and push the latest content to them. As most Hugo sites are built in a fraction of a second, you will be able to save and see your changes nearly instantly.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
composer require tesla-software/jmbg
```

## Usage

### Validation
``` php
use Tesla\JMBG\JMBG;

// Check if JMBG is valid
JMBG::for('2509992391801')->isValid(); // Returns: true

// Extract birthday
JMBG::for('2509992391801')->getBirthday(); // Returns: DateTime (1992-09-25)

// Extract gedner (m for males, f for females)
JMBG::for('2509992391801')->getGender(); // Returns: m
```
